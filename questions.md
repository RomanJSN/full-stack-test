How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

- I've spent approximately 2 days on this test assignment. I could also implement all fields provided in JSON file as well as create tests if there was more time available. I would pay more attention to data import. Added filtering by all possible fields and added pagination.

How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- As for the performance, I've debugged all requests, checked each one and added possible indexes, prevented duplicated requests to the database. Yes, I have worked on the improvement of performance before.
